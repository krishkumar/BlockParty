- Currently blocks content from annoying ad networks on all sites thereby loading pages super fast

- Useful for data-capped, international roaming connections

- Blocking rules are at [RediffBlock/blockerList.json](RediffBlock/blockerList.json)

- View JSON in app

## Tested

- iPad mini 2 running iOS 9
- iPhone 6 running iOS 9
- Desktop version tested on beta Safari 9 for Yosemite & El Capitan
- Universal app contains link to Settings, JSON and instructions for turning on Content Blockers

## Device Compatibility

[“Note: Apps containing content blocking extensions for Safari on iOS are available only on 64-bit devices, due to performance limitations of 32-bit devices.”](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/releasenotes/General/WhatsNewInSafari/Articles/Safari_9.html)

The exceptions to this are iPhone 5 and iPhone 5C which have been tested to be working with BlockParty.
